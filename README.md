# DNS Records

All of my DNS records, deployed with [Bacon](https://github.com/jungaretti/bacon).

## Getting Started

I use my [Deploy with Bacon](https://github.com/jungaretti/bacon-deploy-action) action to deploy DNS records from this repo to [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/). To learn more about Bacon and its deploy action, see their repos:
